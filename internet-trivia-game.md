## internet trivia game

- requires nothing but two teams and internet
- simple and elegant: people are in the same room (physically) or online call, split into two teams (red and blue)
- each round one person on one of two teams uses internet (wiki, google etc. ) to state a question about some fact, both teams answer (in turn)
- the team with most points wins
- this is even better than generated questions, because each fact is known/understood by at least the person who found it, so players themselves form the scope, topics and difficulty of questions
- (optional)additionally a google spread sheet can be used for some improvised map of topics where a team is represented by colored borderes of the box and move on the map
